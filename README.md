# dev-ubuntu
A disposable development environment for java, python, and c++

Use this docker container when you need to build something, and want to be sure that all you keep at the end is the binary, not the build dependencies, make tools, or other cruft.

# sshd-ubuntu
A reasonable terminal environment for any NAS that supports docker but can't run bash or doesn't have good tooling. I'm looking at you Synology.
