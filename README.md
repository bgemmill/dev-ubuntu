# dev-ubuntu
A disposable development environment for java, python, and c++

When you need to build something, and want to be sure that all you keep at the end is the binary, not the build dependencies, make tools, or other cruft.

# wine-ubuntu
Run windows programs like a champion

Without needing to install wine's vast list of dependencies onto your host system.

# sshd-ubuntu
A reasonable terminal environment for any NAS that can run docker

When your NAS runs docker but not bash. I'm looking at you, Synology.

# sslh-ubuntu
Protocol multiplexing in case some ports aren't available

Why be strict about protocols and ports?
