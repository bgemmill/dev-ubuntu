# dev-ubuntu
A disposable development environment for java, python, and c++

When you need to build something, and want to be sure that all you keep at the end is the binary, not the build dependencies, make tools, or other cruft.

# sshd-ubuntu
A reasonable terminal environment for any NAS that can run docker

When your NAS runs docker but not bash. I'm looking at you, Synology.
