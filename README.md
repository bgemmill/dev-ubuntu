# dev
A disposable development environment for java, python, and c++

When you need to build something, and want to be sure that all you keep at the end is the binary, not the build dependencies, make tools, or other cruft.

# wine
Run windows programs like a champion

Without needing to install wine's vast list of dependencies onto your host system.

# sshd
A reasonable terminal environment for any NAS that can run docker

When your NAS runs docker but not bash. I'm looking at you, Synology.

# sslh
Protocol multiplexing in case some ports aren't available

Why be strict about protocols and ports?

# acd
Amazon Cloud Drive as an encrypted borg backup target for diskstations

When you want to back up all of your stuff and not show Amazon what it is. Note that you'll need to map in your encryption keys as /input/. Be sure to look at the example input directory for what it wants.
